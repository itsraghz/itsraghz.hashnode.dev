## Angular - Creating a component without the test spec

## Welcome to the Series

Welcome to the [**Angular App Development**](https://hashnode.com/series/angular-app-development-ck20ac9og0006i5s14kk9dyxy) series, where we will learn the ingredients of Angular and the step by step processing of creating an Angular App - through the motto *learning by doing*.

## Till now....
In the previous post [**Angular - Creating a Component**](https://itsraghz.hashnode.dev/angular-creating-a-component-ck20b93060013i5s18i8ygqv8), we have seen the way to create a Component through ```ng generate component``` component, and the list of files being generated by Angular along with the benefits over creating them manually. 

There are 4 files being created as follows by *ng generate component* command. 

- the main .component.ts file (```xyz.component.ts```) ==> xyz is the name of your component
- the HTML file (```xyz.component.html```)
- the CSS file (```xyz.component.css```)
- the Unit Testing specification file (```xyz.component.spec.ts```)

## In this post.... 
Mostly we may not need the Unit Testing in the beginning stages or until we have firmed up our understanding to really start creating an App and writing the Unit Tests. There is a rescue in the same ```ng generate component``` or the short cut ```ng g c <componentName>``` in the form of an argument ```--spec false```. 

### Using the '--spec false' argument

```
ng g c login --spec false
```
Here we wanted to create a component named **Login** (the actual class gets created will be **LoginComponent**) but without any Unit Test specification file. ```--spec false``` helps us to exclude the test spec file. 

```
λ ng g c login --spec false
Option "spec" is deprecated: Use "skipTests" instead.
CREATE src/app/login/login.component.html (20 bytes)
CREATE src/app/login/login.component.ts (265 bytes)
CREATE src/app/login/login.component.css (0 bytes)
UPDATE src/app/app.module.ts (557 bytes)
```
If you see, the files being generated are only 3 - the .ts, .html and .css and there is no ```.spec.ts``` file created. 

> **Note : ** This command is deprecated in the latest version of Angular and the command itself suggests an alternate by using **skipTests** as a command line argument in place of ```--spec false``` to get the same purpose. 

### Using the --skipTests argument

The below command shows the new component **error** gets created by using ```--skipTests``` argument on the command line. 

```
λ ng generate component error --skipTests
CREATE src/app/error/error.component.html (20 bytes)
CREATE src/app/error/error.component.ts (265 bytes)
CREATE src/app/error/error.component.css (0 bytes)
UPDATE src/app/app.module.ts (697 bytes)
```

The error component is created with the 3 required files (.ts, .html and .css) without any Unit Test specification file. As usual, the main ```app.module.ts``` file gets updated with the details of the new component created just now.
